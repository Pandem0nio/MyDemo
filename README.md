In this repository there are some demos that I've used during events or trainings.

Demos:
- fakedata. It is a solutions with two console application project in C#. The first one, CarDeviceIdentity is used to register the other one console application as a device on the Azure IoT Hub. The second one, fakedata is a console application that sends data about a simulated car trip to the Azure IoT Hub. 
- CustomVMSS. It is a Azure Resource Manager template solution to create an Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set with a custom image and a configuration of autoscaling (in this case by the CPU Percentage usage).
